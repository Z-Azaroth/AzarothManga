# Information

**Quickly, some crucial information about the creation of the manga is mentioned below.**

**Firstly, a vital aspect to point out is that the manga is not going to be released to view until the first 3 manga books are created.**
**Second, the 3 books published are going to be completely free to view and read.**
**Third and lastly, this is managed and worked upon by me and no one else at the moment causing many delays in creation and most likely a decent amount of time for the manga to be created and for story to be made.**

## Story

**The manga and story is going to be seperated into two entire different parts.**
**To Elaborate, the story is going to be its own product while the manga, although taking the story and bringing it into life, will also be its own product.**

**Important: The storyline will obviously be created first.**
## Manga

**The reason behind the 3 first books of manga being released all at once is due to tweaks being made in storyline and drawing.**

**The entire manga is going to be a hybrid type of drawing style for the most part, this is due to me having to go to different areas and using different types of art types and styles.**
